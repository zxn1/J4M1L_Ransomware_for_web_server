1. Create a new Laravel application or use an existing one.
2. Define your API routes in the api.php file in the routes folder.
3. Define your API controllers and their methods.
4. Install the darkaonline/swagger-lume package using Composer to add support for Swagger 
   annotations in Laravel.
5. Annotate your API routes and controllers with Swagger annotations to define the metadata 
   needed for Swagger documentation.
6. Use the php artisan swagger-lume:generate command to generate the Swagger documentation 
   in either JSON or YAML format.
7. Use a Swagger UI tool, such as Swagger UI or Redoc, to display the generated 
   documentation in a user-friendly format.

There are many tutorials and resources available online that can guide you through this process in more detail. Additionally, the darkaonline/swagger-lume package documentation provides detailed instructions on how to use Swagger annotations in Laravel.
